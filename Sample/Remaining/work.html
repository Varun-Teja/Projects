		<p>It's fascinating to be a student. But what is it like to be in the shoes of a professor? Well, I for one, exactly know how that feels. I worked as a GTA for Computer Networks in The University of Texas at Arlington during my Master's. My responsibilities included preparing exam papers, giving presentations and lectures, assigning projects from the course work. It is really quite different from the other end of the spectrum as you're the one who is imparting knowledge to people. So, there is a certain amount of added pressure and weight on your shoulders in the sense that if you know something, you have to be spot on just about everything regarding it. If the students wouldn't understand any parts of that day's lecture, more often than not I'd be the poor chap bombarded with questions left, right and center. I had to be perfect just about everytime and doing this helped me deeply understand some concepts I couldn't properly grasp when I took up Computer Networks as a student. As I was the one who was tasked with giving projects to the students, I got the amazing opportunity to discover several ins and outs and really learn how few things in networks technically work. It would be an understatement to say that being a Graduate Teaching Assistant greatly helped me develop as an individual.</p>
